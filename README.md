# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project was to create a daily workday planner to record simple tasks that can be saved and will populate to the page when reloaded. This application uses the Dayjs API to display an updated day and time, and color the schedule differently depending on the time. This also uses local storage to record tasks.
